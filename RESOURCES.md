An "instruction" describes an "operation" to be performed. Each instruction is composed of an "opcode", the portion of the instruction that determines the type of operation to be performed, and any number of "operands" that are or refer to the data to be operated on.

opcodes are defined as part of the "instruction set architecture (ISA)" of a processor.
